# Mini Data Analysis Project
<p>This is a small project developed for the purpose of learning and training Pandas package
applications for Data Analysis.</p>

## About the database
<p>For this project there are three database sources originated from a service provider company:</p>

+ CadastroFuncionarios.csv
+ CadastroClientes.csv
+ BaseServiçosPrestados.xlsx

<p>The first .csv file is a database containing the company's employees information
such as name, salary and work area. The second .csv file contains information regarding
each client's name and their monthly contract price. The .xlsx file includes the information
related to the company's orders such as, which employee was responsible for each order, 
which client signed each contract, how many months the client has signed for.</p>

## Analysis Objective
<p> This analysis has the objective of identifying six indicators:</p>

1) Total Payroll Value
2) Company's Total Revenue
3) The percentage of employees that have successfully signed a contract
4) Total sales each area of the company has made
5) Number of employees per company area
6) Average Monthly Revenue

<p>Note: this is a project developed for academic purposes, therefore the
data contained in "CadastroFuncionarios.csv", "CadastroClientes.csv" and
"BaseServiçosPrestados.xlsx" files are fictitious and used only to learn
Pandas packages applications.</p>
